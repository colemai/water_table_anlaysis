Plan:

Import Data

Decide a data-type for each column

Assign data type, solving each error as it arises until the assignation runs through

Visually assess dataframe for other systematic errors e.g are zeros real or are some meant as Null. Solve

Replace missing, corrupt or suspect data with null/column mean - case by case human decision based on previous experience

Encode categorical and binary columns

Plot distribution of each column

Normalise and standardise where appropriate

Use human understanding of dataset to determine if any feature engineering needed - combining variables or exponent 

Test each column pairing for correlation/distance

From this identify dependent variable pairings

Control for these dependencies

Correlate each column against outcome variable

From this select variables to put in model

Determine model-comparison metric(s)

Consider best models, implement top 2/3

Compare model performance

Brainstorm on further improvements
